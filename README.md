# DestinyLevelingUtility

DestinyLevelingUtility, or DLU, is a single page progressive web app built with Angular CLI and Semantic UI.

## What

DLU calculates the power of characters based on the gear level the user has entered. It then marks slots that can be upgraded with on-level drops for a power increase.

## Why

Using on-level drops from the season pass or random rewards is the key to efficient and fast leveling. However, it is also easy to miss this opportunity when leveling three characters at the same time. That's where DLU comes into play.

## How

DLU does not require an internet connection in order to work and only stores data in the browsers localstorage. Thus, DLU is essentially an offline app that can be used on any modern device capable of installing progressive web applications.

## Where

DLU can be found under https://destiny.yeger.eu.
